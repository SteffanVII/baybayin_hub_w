          <!-- <p class="resort-header__contents-container__resort-description" >La Union is one of the four prominent provinces in Region 1. Dubbed as the Surfing Capital of the North, tourists do not usually mind the long-hour travel just to have that once-in- a-lifetime experience with the waves and seas.  The province of La Union definitely knows how to give a good time, and it allows millennials to have fun in an insane manner. The province is a place to be chill and laid-back; but when it comes to having a good time, it is certainly one of the best places to lose yourself in. ELYUÂ is where millennials can relish every bit of their youthful years and meet new acquaintances. A place where they can be carefree and probably unleash a little bit of that of wildness. Although La Union is the perfect getaway for peace and serenity, it can also give you the best night of your life.</p> -->
